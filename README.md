# google-homepage

This is my attempt to recreate the google homepage according to the tutorial at The Odin Project.

After I complete this project I will reflect on it


-------------------------------------------------------
Highlights:
-Solidified knowledge of how to use relative and absolute positioning for divs

-Successfully used id's to modify individual elements on a page

-Used dev tools to work out errors in my own code

-------------------------------------------------------
Things to work on:
-Have a better work flow, start from top to bottom of page to avoid errors/bugs

-Try to organize html/css more coherently

-------------------------------------------------------
Questions:
-How can I use classes to improve my code?

-How do I adjust fonts within a form?

-How do I make a functional form?
